# Mindful Browsing

A FireFox extension meant to bring mindfullness to web browsing.

## How It Works

1. Add a domain to the blacklist in settings.
2. When navigating to that domain, you'll be made aware that you're navigating to that domain.
3. Acknowledge and continue or go back to what you were doing.
